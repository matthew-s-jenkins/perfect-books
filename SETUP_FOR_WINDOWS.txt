PERFECT BOOKS - QUICK START GUIDE FOR WINDOWS
=============================================================

Hi! Here's how to get Perfect Books running on your Windows PC:

STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON (if you don't have it)
----------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer for Windows
3. Run the installer
4. IMPORTANT: Check the box "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom!
5. Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts


STEP 2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in the Start menu)
2. Navigate to this folder:
   cd C:\path\to\Perfect_Books
   (Tip: Type "cd " and drag the Perfect_Books folder into Command Prompt)
3. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


STEP 3: RUN PERFECT BOOKS
--------------------------
Option A - Double-click (Easiest):
  1. Find "START_WINDOWS.bat" in the Perfect_Books folder
  2. Double-click it
  3. If Windows SmartScreen appears, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
  4. Your browser will open automatically!

Option B - Command Prompt:
  1. Open Command Prompt
  2. Navigate to Perfect_Books folder
  3. Run: python start.py


FIRST TIME SETUP
-----------------
When the browser opens:
1. Click "Register" on the login page
2. Create a username and password
3. Start tracking your finances!


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If you get "'python' is not recognized" error:
  - Python wasn't added to PATH during installation
  - Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
  - Or manually add Python to your PATH environment variable

If you get "pip is not recognized" error:
  - Try: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If double-clicking START_WINDOWS.bat opens Notepad:
  - Right-click the file
  - Choose "Open with" > "Windows Command Processor"

If the browser doesn't open automatically:
  - Manually go to: http://127.0.0.1:5001

If Windows Defender or antivirus blocks it:
  - This is a false positive (the app runs a local web server)
  - Add Perfect_Books folder to your antivirus exceptions


HOW TO UPDATE PERFECT BOOKS
---------------------------
When there's a new version:
1. Delete the old Perfect_Books folder
2. Download the new version
3. Double-click START_WINDOWS.bat
4. Your data will be restored automatically!

Your financial data is safely backed up to:
  Documents\PerfectBooks_Data\

You don't need to do anything - backups happen automatically
every time you start the app.
