Perfect Books - Files to Clean Up Before GitHub Commit
======================================================

RECOMMENDED TO DELETE:
- session_controller.py (not used - app has built-in session management)
- START_PERFECT_BOOKS.vbs (RUN.bat is better)
- USING_SESSION_CONTROLLER.md (documentation for unused module)

RECOMMENDED TO KEEP:
- RUN.bat (easy launcher for the app)
- START_HERE.md (helpful user guide - or merge into README)

OPTIONAL - YOUR CHOICE:
- START_HERE.md (keep if you want user-facing docs)

Commands to delete the unused files:
cd c:\Projects\Perfect_Books
del session_controller.py
del START_PERFECT_BOOKS.vbs
del USING_SESSION_CONTROLLER.md

Or keep them if you think they might be useful later!
